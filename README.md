Unity3D (http://unity3d.com/download)
OpenNI 1.5.4 SDK 32-bit (http://www.openni.org/openni-sdk/openni-sdk-history-2/)
A Kinect camera

The OpenNI library requires the use of pointers inside a threaded environment. C# only allows this when the project is compiled with the unsafe flag. Therefore the unsafe flag is required to compile this game. This flag is already set for the Unity project using the Assets/smcs.rsp file.

The C# project and solution files are automatically generated by Unity and are not guaranteed to compile without Unity.

Our scripts are to be found in the Assets/scripts folder.

The input method can be set using the preprocessor directives in Assets/scripts/AvatarBehaviour.cs. When the Kinect is not used, the project should be able to compile without OpenNI, however this is not officially tested/supported
